# FI-DUSGAN
This is the official implementation for [Video Frame Interpolation Via Down-Up Scale Generative Adversarial Networks (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2022.103434).

# Requirements
For using this implementation, we recommend PyTorch with version 1.5.0 or later.

# Dataset
The target dataset of this implementation is the Vimeo-90k dataset. The sample data directory is organized following the frame interpolation subset of the Vimeo90k.

Please see the Vimeo-90k dataset documentation for more details.

# Run the code
```python train.py --path=cpt_folder```

# Pre-trained model
